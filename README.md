## Note:
 React uses `_localhost:3000_` and Spring API uses `_localhost:8080_`. In order to run both of them, the ports 8080 and 3000 must be accessible and usable.
### Write this command to check the task for the specific port : `netstat -ano | findstr :8080`. If the port is busy now, you can kill the task by using taskid : `TASKKILL //PID 10524 //F`.**
